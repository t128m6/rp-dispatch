This little piece of software is basically just existing to work. Code is not pretty/optimized nor would I do it like this again ;).

It was intended to be used by the taxi company on an FiveM roleplay server, but never got to the working stage since the players didn't accepted some kind of dispatch


This repo is basically the entire package, including favicon, logos and css(yes I suck if it comes to css(!)don't judge me by that). Simply upload it to your webspace and start using.
